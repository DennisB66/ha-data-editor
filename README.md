## Description

HA Data Editor is a custom integration for Home Assistant that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and editing device and entity properties directly within the Home Assistant UI. This integration includes a custom panel equipped with an editable table, allowing users to view and effortlessly modify device details, such as names and areas.

**Initial Release**: The project is in its early stages. Currently, it only supports changing the area of devices. Future updates will expand this functionality to include changing other information and supporting other data registries such as entities, areas, users, etc.

**Note**: The user interface may not be aesthetically pleasing at the moment, but it is functional. Improvements to the UI are planned for future updates.

## Features

- **Device & Entity Management**: List all Home Assistant devices and entities in a tabular format for easy viewing and quick modifications.
- **Editable Fields**: Interactively edit fields directly within the table for efficient updates.
- **Seamless UI Integration**: Integrates as a custom panel within the Home Assistant UI, maintaining a consistent user experience.
- **Efficient Backend Services**: Ensures smooth communication and timely updates between the frontend and Home Assistant backend.
